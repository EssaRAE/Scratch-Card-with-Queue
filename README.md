# Scratch with Data Structures

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook **"Scratch with Data Structures"**, designed to explore and implement data structure concepts. The notebook provides both theoretical explanations and practical code examples, making it useful for learning and revising data structures.

## Overview

The notebook consists of **17 cells**, categorized as follows:
- **Markdown Cells**: Provide explanations, context, and theoretical insights.
- **Code Cells**: Contain Python implementations of data structures and related operations.
- **Raw Cells**: Include content that is not executed but may hold additional information.

## Purpose

This notebook is intended for students and professionals who want to:
- Understand the fundamentals of data structures.
- Practice coding implementations of various data structures in Python.
- Review theoretical concepts with examples and explanations.

## Structure

The notebook includes the following sections:
1. **Introduction**: Overview of data structures and their importance.
2. **Implementation Examples**: Python code snippets for:
   - Arrays
   - Linked Lists
   - Stacks
   - Queues
   - Trees
   - Graphs
3. **Theoretical Concepts**: Markdown cells explaining the principles and applications of each data structure.
4. **Raw Notes**: Additional unprocessed content for further development.
